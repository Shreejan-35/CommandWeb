As we all know that, ![CommandConsole](https://github.com/Shreejan-35/CommandConsole) - a shell, which is being published recently in Github, is being downloaded and used by many.

So, I decided to make a **docs** website for it, in which there should be :-
- Overview
- Installation
- Contribution(Nothing but the guide to contribute to CommandConsole)
- Get Started

It will be beneficial for all those who have downloaded the CommandConsole and also for them who wanted to use it.
So, I thought for some new ideas and this ideas came to my mind:-
- CommandConsole in web. Yes the shell can now be interacted in web.(Coming Soon)
- Full guidance
- A discord server

It will be one of the greatest accomplishment to make a website related to CommandConsole.
The backend need to be powerful. So I thought of using **Flask** as the web framework and it is easy to use.

**In the static folder, all the static files are there.**
**In the templates folder, all the web files are present.**

I wish a very good future of our project and want many developers to join us.
